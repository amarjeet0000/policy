            <h3>8. Order Changes and Cancellations</h3>
            <p>
                You may modify or cancel your order within 15 minutes of placing it, provided the order 
                hasn't been processed for shipping. Once an order is in the shipping process, changes 
                cannot be guaranteed. For cancellations after the 15-minute window but before shipping, 
                a cancellation fee of 5% may apply.
            </p>
            
            <h3>9. International Shipping</h3>
            <p>
                Currently, we only ship within India. We do not offer international shipping services.
            </p>
            
            <h3>10. Delivery During Special Circumstances</h3>
            <p>
                During festivals, extreme weather conditions, or local restrictions, delivery times may 
                be extended. We will communicate any known delays through our platform, email, or SMS 
                notifications. In case of government-imposed lockdowns or curfews, we will follow all 
                applicable guidelines and may offer contactless delivery options.
